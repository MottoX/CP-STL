# Competitive Programming Standard Template Library
My past C++ template for competitive programming: ACM-ICPC, Codeforces, Topcoder, Google Code Jam, etc.
I have not participated in online competitions for a fairly long time, and the template is potentially outdated.

Note that the files in this library are snippets instead of executable programs.
